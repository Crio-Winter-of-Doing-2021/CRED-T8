### Objective

Build a Credit Card Management system (web application) which can handle the entire lifecycle of a customerâ€™s credit card. Functionality like adding and verifying credit card(s), fetching the credit card statement to generate a summary and extract insights and making payments for the card. The system should have a UI which gives the customers a clean interface to use.

### How To Get Started

1. Clone the repository

2. ``` cd backend ``` and create a folder named ```config```. Inside that folder make a file named ``` config.json ```

3. Content of ``` config.json ``` should be similar to this.
> Note: We are using mysql as a dialect(for storing data). You can use any dialect like Postgress, MariaDB, SQLite and Microsoft SQL Server. But you have to change ```config.json``` accordingly.

```json
{
    "development": {
      "username": "<db_user>",
      "password": "<password>",
      "database": "cred_dev",
      "host": "127.0.0.1",
      "dialect": "mysql"
    },
    "test": {
      "username": "<db_user>",
      "password": "<password>",,
      "database": "cred_test",
      "host": "127.0.0.1",
      "dialect": "mysql"
    },
    "production": {
      "username": "<db_user>",
      "password": "<password>",
      "database": "cred_prod",
      "host": "127.0.0.1",
      "dialect": "mysql"
    }
  }
```
4. In ``` backend ``` directory create a file named ``` .env ```

5. Content of ``` .env ``` should be similar to this

```
PORT=5000
SECRET=<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>
ENCRYPTION_KEY=<YOUR_ENCRYPTION_KEY>
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=<TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID>
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=<TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN>
TWILIO_PHONE_NO=<TWILIO_PHONE_NO>
EMAIL=<AN_EMAIl_ID>
EMAIL_PAS=<EMAIL_PASSWORD>
```

6. In ```backend``` directory run ``` npm install ```.

7. ``` cd frontend ``` and create a file named ``` .env ```.

8. Content of ``` .env ``` should be similar to this.
```
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL_DEV=http://localhost:5000/
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL_PROD=<BACKEND_DEPLOYED_URL>
```

9. In ``` frontend ``` directory run ``` npm install ```

10. ``` cd backend ``` and exectute following command
```
npm run dev - to run server and client concurrently
npm run server - to run server standalone
npm run client - to run client standalone.
```
